Luxury Wheels is a car rental company. The application is dedicated to fleet management, allowing us to view all information about Reservations made, Vehicles (whether rented or not), Customer details, Payment Methods, and even other Users. However, if you are not an administrator, you will not have access to manage Users or view activities performed by users in the application.

This project was assigned to me as part of the Final Project at Tokio School, and the requirements were primarily to display the information on the initial Dashboard, as well as manage Reservations, Customers, Vehicles, Users, and Payment Methods. Within the scope of the project, I decided to add some extra functionalities, such as:

Log-In Window
Administrators functionality
Viewing information in tables, not just in graphs
Viewing detailed information
Preventing deletion of a vehicle that is currently reserved
Viewing information by year (initially, it was only required by month)
This was a challenging but very engaging project that I thoroughly enjoyed working on. Being my first large-scale project, clear improvements can be seen in the code from start to finish, becoming more organized and clean over time (the dashboard was the final step of development).
